# MUGIC Positioning

The [MUGIC device](http://www.marikimura.com/mugic-sensor.html) bridges what is audible with what is mobile, measuring the movement of the musician who wears it and enabling new methods of performance driven by data. Many various applications of this device have been developed, ranging from the alteration of instrumental sounds to the real-time synthesis of a musical track.

In this project, we leverage the device's capabilities as a metric of its wearer's instrumental technique, particularly in the case of a violinist. In having a violinist wear the device on the hand used for bowing, we can measure the motion of their bowing and assess the stability in which they play their instrument.
